# Tea Testnet Scripts

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to interact with the Tea Testnet, a high-performance blockchain test network. These scripts allow users to perform various actions such as claiming TEA from the deploying token and NFT contracts, minting tokens/NFTs, sending transactions, and managing assets on the Tea Testnet using its RPC. Each script is built with the `web3.py` library and offers bilingual support (English and Vietnamese) for user interaction.

## Features Overview

### General Features

- **Multi-Account Support**: Reads private keys from `pvkey.txt` to perform actions across multiple accounts.
- **Colorful CLI**: Uses `colorama` for visually appealing output with colored text and borders.
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Built with `asyncio` for efficient blockchain interactions.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching for blockchain transactions and RPC issues.
- **Bilingual Support**: Supports both English and Vietnamese output based on user selection.

### Included Scripts

1. **sendtx.py**: Send random TEA transactions or to addresses from address.txt on Tea Testnet.
2. **deploytoken.py**: Deploy an ERC20 token smart contract on Tea Testnet.
3. **sendtoken.py**: Send ERC20 tokens to random addresses or from addressERC20.txt on Tea Testnet.
4. **nftcollection.py**: Deploy and manage an NFT smart contract (Create, Mint, Burn) on Tea Testnet.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- `pip` (Python package manager)
- **Dependencies**: Install via `pip install -r requirements.txt` (ensure `web3.py`, `colorama`, `asyncio`, `eth-account`, and `inquirer` are included).
- **pvkey.txt**: Add private keys (one per line) for wallet automation.
- Access to the MegaETH Testnet RPC (https://tea-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/public hoáº·c RPC API key)
- **address.txt / addressERC20.txt**: Optional files for specifying recipient addresses.
